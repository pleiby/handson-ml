Notes on Setting up Workspace for Machine Learning Notebooks
=============================================================

- notes by Paul Leiby, 20190914

### For Geron 2019 _Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow_

#### Installing jupyter and mlbook notebooks
- [Machine Learning Notebooks - Installation]
(https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml#starting-jupyter)
`conda create -n mlbook python=3.5 anaconda`
`conda activate mlbook`
`conda install -n mlbook -c conda-forge tensorflow`

#### [installing jupyter lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html): 
- When running under anaconda environment

    `conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab`
- Prerequisites
    - JupyterLab requires the Jupyter Notebook version 4.3 or later. 
    - To check the version of the notebook package that you have installed:

jupyter notebook --version- Installing with Previous Versions of Notebook
    - If you are using a version of Jupyter Notebook earlier than 5.3, then you must also run the following command to enable the JupyterLab server extension:

    `jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab --sys-prefix`

#### Start Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Start JupyterLab using:

`jupyter lab`
